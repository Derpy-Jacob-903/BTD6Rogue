General Disclaimer:

This mod is UNTESTED in anything other than the solo base game

If you use this mod in:
- Quests
- Daily Challenges
- Events
- Coop
- All that other stuff

You're on your own. I do plan on figuring out Coop for this mod, but for the time being I got other priorities. Feel free to test this on your own though, if you
find any bugs, think of any suggestions, and other stuff. Hit me up on my Discord, that's where I'm most active.

And hey, if you're a content creator, and want to use this mod for a video, stream, or anything. Feel free, I made this as a fun gamemode for people to play
I would appreciate a credit for making the mod, but it's not required

I recommend playing this mod with the FasterForward mod. While Bloons TD6 is a great base for a Roguelike-esc game
Repeating the same map over and over gets tedious in my opinion. So a 5x or even 10x speed makes it feel 100x less monotonous

In any case, hope you enjoy the mod! :D
