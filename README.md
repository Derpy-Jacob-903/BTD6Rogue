Version 3.0.0

Welcome back to BTD6Rogue rewritten from the ground up (for the most part)

As my vision for this mod expanded it became very obvious that my poorly written code when I was first
learning how to mod BTD6 was not able to handle a huge amount of the features I had planned

So I have torn my code apart and tried my best to rework the entire mod to run better, be easier to fix bugs
and make new features without jumping through dozens of hoops created by spaghetti code

General Disclaimer:
This mod is currently UNTESTED in anything other than singleplayer in the base game
Quests, Daily Challenges, Events, Coop, Bosses, Custom Maps, and everything else is completely untested

And hey, if you're a content creator, and want to use this mod for a video, stream, or anything. Feel free, I made this as a fun gamemode for people to play
I would appreciate a credit for making the mod, but it's not required

In any case, hope you enjoy the mod! :D
